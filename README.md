## About Me
I specialise in intelligence-led detection engineering, threat hunting, adversary behaviour analysis, and incident response across enterprise environments. My work focuses on transforming real intrusion tradecraft into structured defensive controls and high-fidelity detections.

Areas I work on:
- Behaviour-driven KQL / LQL rule engineering  
- MITRE ATT&CK threat modelling and kill-chain mapping  
- CTI-enriched detection logic (MISP, OpenCTI)  
- Supply-chain attack replication and detection (SolarWinds, 3CX, F5, NotPetya)  
- Identity-driven attacks (OAuth consent, token abuse, cloud persistence)  
- BYOVD, DLL sideloading, driver drift analysis  
- C2 detection (jitter, timing patterns, rare-port telemetry)  
- Red-team technique replication & modern attack vectors  

My GitHub work aims to provide practical, production-aligned artefacts: rulepacks, detection matrices, pivot tables, and structured threat-hunting frameworks that can be used directly by SOC and IR teams.

## Core Focus Areas
• KQL detection engineering (MDE / Sentinel)  
• Adversary tradecraft & MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
• MISP / OpenCTI-driven enrichment workflows  
• Threat hunting (identity, persistence, LOLBins, lateral movement, C2)  
• Incident response and kill-chain reconstruction  
• Supply-chain modelling and detection engineering  
• STIX/TAXII ingestion, IOC processing, campaign analysis
