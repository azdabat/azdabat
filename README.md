## 🧩 About Me
I’m a senior cyber security analyst focused on **intelligence-driven detection engineering**, advanced SOC investigations, and adversary-aligned threat hunting.  

My work bridges **Threat Intelligence → Detection → Incident Response**, enabling organisations to detect attacks such as **SolarWinds, 3CX, NotPetya, F5 BIG-IP exploitation**, and modern identity-based threats.

I specialise in:
- High-fidelity **KQL/Falcon LQL** detection logic  
- **DLL sideloading**, **driver abuse (BYOVD)**, **search-order hijacking**, **SMB lateral movement**  
- **OAuth consent abuse**, cloud identity attacks, token leakage  
- CTI enrichment using **MISP, OpenCTI, OSINT**  
- Telemetry engineering and mapping to **MITRE ATT&CK**  
- Real-world incident replication and supply-chain intrusion modelling  

Outside of commercial work, I maintain a research portfolio focused on **emerging N-days, 0-days, AI-driven threat variation**, and high-confidence SOC hunting models.
