## About Me
I am a senior cyber security analyst specialising in **intelligence-led detection engineering**, adversary simulation, and high-fidelity threat hunting across both endpoint and cloud attack surfaces.

My work focuses on transforming **real-world threat intelligence** into **defensive depth**, using MITRE-aligned TTP modelling, telemetry mapping, and high-signal rule logic. I build end-to-end artefacts that combine:

- KQL & Falcon LQL detection engineering  
- ATT&CK-based threat modelling  
- MISP/OpenCTI enrichment pipelines  
- Supply-chain intrusion replication (SolarWinds, 3CX, NotPetya, F5 BIG-IP)  
- Identity & OAuth abuse detection  
- DLL sideloading, driver abuse (BYOVD) & component-level persistence  

My GitHub portfolio contains **production-ready detection rules**, **pivot matrices**, **TTP breakdowns**, and **campaign-level CTI analysis** designed to support SOC, IR, and threat hunting teams.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and I contribute to it daily.

## Core Focus Areas

• KQL Detection Engineering (MDE + Sentinel)
• Adversary Behaviour Analysis (MITRE ATT&CK)
• Threat Intelligence (MISP, OpenCTI, OSINT pivoting)
• Threat Hunting (identity abuse, LOLBins, persistence, C2)
• Incident Response (triage, correlation, containment)
• Supply-Chain & RCE Attack Modeling (SolarWinds, 3CX, F5, NotPetya)
• STIX/TAXII/JSON-based CTI automation and IOC processing + Threat Modelling
