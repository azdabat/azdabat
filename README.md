> [!NOTE]
> **This project is in its early, active development phase. Much of the core functionality is robust and working well. Current efforts are focused on completing modular components, replacing initial integration placeholders, and iteratively optimizing performance and configuration rules. A production-ready release is targeted for completion early next year. This is an evolving project that needs production testing (soon to deploy)**

## About Me
I’m a senior cyber security analyst specialising in **intelligence-led detection engineering**, high-fidelity **threat hunting**, and **incident response** across modern enterprise environments.

My focus is on transforming **real adversary tradecraft** into **production-grade detection rules**, A few examples:

- Behaviour-first KQL / LQL engineering  
- MITRE-aligned threat modelling  
- CTI enrichment from MISP + OpenCTI  
- Supply-chain attack replication and detection (3CX, SolarWinds, F5, NotPetya)  
- Identity attacks: OAuth consent, cloud tokens, persistence  
- Driver-level abuse (BYOVD), DLL sideloading  
- C2 detection using jitter, timing analysis, and rare-port telemetry
- Evolving threat landscape and threat intelligence modeling and hunting
- Red-teaming, Pentesting playbooks and real-world attack vectors
- etc...

My work focuses on transforming **real-world threat intelligence** into **defensive depth**, using MITRE-aligned TTP modelling, telemetry mapping, and high-signal rule logic. I build end-to-end artefacts that combine:

## Core Focus Areas

• KQL Detection Engineering (MDE + Sentinel)
• Adversary Behaviour Analysis (MITRE ATT&CK)
• Threat Intelligence (MISP, OpenCTI, OSINT pivoting)
• Threat Hunting (identity abuse, LOLBins, persistence, C2)
• Incident Response (triage, correlation, containment)
• Supply-Chain & RCE Attack Modeling (SolarWinds, 3CX, F5, NotPetya)
• STIX/TAXII/JSON-based CTI automation and IOC processing + Threat Modelling
