## Router Rules vs Primitives — The Three-Layer Detection Architecture

Before discussing minimum truth based detection engineering logic we must understand Router Rules and how they are different from substrate and intent based substrate engineering logic.

> *"A primitive captures what happened.*  
> *A router rule asks whether it matters.*  
> *A composite confirms that it does."*

---

### Primitives Are Atomic

A primitive is the irreducible telemetric fact. It answers one question with zero inference:

```
scrcons.exe loaded vbscript.dll
bitsadmin.exe executed
rundll32.exe invoked comsvcs.dll
```

No scoring. No context. No intent. Just the raw substrate event captured and indexed. Primitives live in the **atomic sentinel layer** — the silent 30-day rolling index that catches what composites miss and connects Day 0 staging to Day 3 activation.

---

### Router Rules Are Behavioural Threat Hunts

A router rule is a behavioural hunt that has been given structure, a scoring model, and a routing output. It asks a higher-order question than a primitive:

```
Is there evidence of ingress transfer intent anywhere on this estate?
Is there evidence of AD reconnaissance activity anywhere on this estate?
Is there evidence of script proxy execution intent anywhere on this estate?
```

These are hunt hypotheses expressed as always-on rules. The four-phase MTDF structure, the convergence scoring, the soft penalties, the routing directive — all of that is behavioural analysis, not raw telemetry capture. A router rule is operationally a threat hunt that has been promoted to a scheduled detection.

---

### The Three-Layer Model

```mermaid
graph TD
    P["PRIMITIVE LAYER\nAtomic substrate facts\nNo scoring · No inference\nSilent 30-day index\n'scrcons.exe loaded vbscript.dll'\n'bitsadmin.exe executed'"]

    R["ROUTER RULE LAYER\nBehavioural threat hunt\nIntent detection across surfaces\nScored · Routed · Temporary\n'Is ingress transfer in progress?'\n'Is AD recon in progress?'"]

    C -->|"HunterDirective:\nMinimum truth confirmed"| I
    P -->|"Direct stitch\nwhen composite\nnot yet built"| I
```

---

### The Practical Distinction

| Layer | Question Asked | Output | Lifecycle |
|-------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **Primitive** | Did this substrate event exist? | Raw indexed fact | Permanent |
| **Router Rule** | Is this adversary goal in progress? | RoutingDirective | Temporary |
| **Composite Sensor** | Did this specific attack happen? | HunterDirective | Permanent |
| **Incident Layer** | What is the full attack story? | Narrative + blast radius | Case lifecycle |

---

### What Happens When You Strip a Router Rule Down

Strip the scoring, remove the routing, remove the phase structure, keep only the Phase 1 filter — you get a primitive collector. That is literally what the atomic sentinel layer is built from.

The Phase 1 broad surface filter of Hunt Pack 04 (Ingress Tool Transfer), run with no threshold and no scoring, becomes a primitive index of every LOLBin downloader execution on the estate for the last 30 days.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph RR["Router Rule\nHunt Pack 04"]
        P1["Phase 1\nBroad filter\nbitsadmin · certutil\ncurl · powershell"]
        P2["Phase 2\nSignal enrichment\nIsMasqueraded · HasScript\nBadParent · StagingPath"]
        P3["Phase 3\nRouting score\nBase 0 · Threshold 30"]
        P4["Phase 4\nRoutingDirective\nPIVOT TO composite"]
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    subgraph Primitive["Primitive Collector\nStripped to Phase 1 only"]
        PP1["Phase 1 filter only\nbitsadmin · certutil\ncurl · powershell\nNo scoring · No threshold\n30-day rolling index"]
    end

    subgraph Composite["Composite Sensor\nT1197 BITSAdmin"]
        C1["Minimum truth\nbitsadmin /transfer\n+ remote URL"]
        C2["Reinforcement\nstaging path · parent\nextension · domain"]
        C3["Score + threshold\nBase 55 · >= 75"]
        C4["HunterDirective\nconfirms truth"]
        C1 --> C2 --> C3 --> C4
    end

    PP1 -.->|"30-day index\nentity key"| Composite
    RR -->|"RoutingDirective"| Composite

    style Primitive fill:#0a1a0f,stroke:#00ff88,color:#00ff88
    style RR fill:#1a1000,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#fcd34d
    style Composite fill:#0a1628,stroke:#00aaff,color:#7dd3fc
```

That is architecturally valid and useful — but it serves a different purpose. The primitive index is the net. The router rule is the structured hunt. The composite is the anchor.

---

### The Insight That Connects All Three

The MTDF framework already implicitly contained all three layers:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Before["MTDF Before Router Rule Doctrine"]
        A1["Atomic Sentinel\nPrimitive collector\nSilent 30-day index"]
        A2["Composite Sensor\nMinimum truth anchor\nHunterDirective"]
        A3["Incident Layer\nNarrative stitching"]
        A1 -->|"Entity key"| A2 --> A3
        A1 -->|"Direct stitch"| A3
    end

    subgraph After["MTDF With Router Rule Doctrine"]
        B1["Atomic Sentinel\nPrimitive collector\nSilent 30-day index"]
        B2["Router Rule\nBehavioural hunt\nIntent detection\nRoutingDirective"]
        B3["Composite Sensor\nMinimum truth anchor\nHunterDirective"]
        B4["Incident Layer\nNarrative stitching"]
        B1 -->|"Entity key"| B3
        B2 -->|"PIVOT TO composite\non DeviceId=X"| B3
        B3 --> B4
        B1 -->|"Direct stitch"| B4
    end
```

The router rule fills the **gap between primitive and composite** — it is the structured behavioural hunt that surfaces intent across technique families while the composites are being built to confirm truth.

### Summary

```
Primitive    → the substrate event, indexed, no inference
Router Rule  → the behavioural hunt, structured, intent-level, temporary
Composite    → the minimum truth confirmation, permanent, high-confidence
Incident     → the narrative, assembled from all three

Strip a router rule to Phase 1 only → primitive collector
Promote a router rule technique to ADX-validated anchor → composite sensor
A router rule that is never retired → coverage debt
A composite without a primitive backing it → gap in the 30-day index
```

> **The primitive is the net.**  
> **The router rule is the structured hunt.**  
> **The composite is the anchor.**  
> **The incident is the story.**

## The Detection Inference Spectrum — All Layers Are Hunts

> *"A primitive captures what happened.*  
> *A router rule asks whether it matters.*  
> *A composite confirms that it does.*  
> *All three are hunts. What changes is the claim being made."*

---

The distinction between primitives, router rules, and composite sensors is not **hunt vs non-hunt**. Every layer is a threat hunt. The distinction is **specificity of claim** and **depth of inference** — how much the rule asserts about what the evidence means, and how much evidence is required before that assertion is made.

---

### The Spectrum of Inference

```mermaid
graph LR
    P["PRIMITIVE\nWhat happened?\nZero inference\n'scrcons.exe loaded vbscript.dll'\nNo scoring\nNo context\nNo claim about intent"]

    R["ROUTER RULE\nIs something bad\nin progress?\nLow-medium inference\n'Ingress transfer intent\ndetected across estate'\nScored · Routed\nClaim: adversary goal"]

    C["COMPOSITE SENSOR\nDid this specific\nattack happen?\nHigh inference\n'bitsadmin /transfer to AppData\nfrom cmd.exe parent confirmed'\nScored + threshold\nClaim: minimum truth"]

    P -->|"Add scoring\nand routing"| R
    R -->|"Narrow to one technique\none noise domain\nADX validate"| C
```

---

### The Claim Each Layer Makes

The difference is not the analytical activity — all three are threat hunts. The difference is what claim the hunt is making and how much evidence is required to make it.

| Layer | Hunt Claim | Evidence Required | Analyst Action |
|-------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Primitive** | "This event occurred" | The event itself — no interpretation | Index it · stitch it later |
| **Router Rule** | "Adversary intent is present" | Convergence of intent signals across a technique family | Triage — run the composite on this DeviceId |
| **Composite Sensor** | "This specific attack occurred" | Minimum truth anchor + optional reinforcement | Investigate — create incident |

---

### The More Accurate Model

Rather than three separate layers, this is a **continuous spectrum of inference** with three operating points that the MTDF has formalised. All three points are active hunts operating at different levels of specificity.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Spectrum["Inference Spectrum — All Are Hunts"]
        direction LR
        A["ATOMIC\nPRIMITIVE\n──────────\nHunt claim:\nEvent occurred\nInference: zero\nThreshold: none\nOutput: indexed fact"]
        B["ROUTER\nRULE\n──────────\nHunt claim:\nIntent present\nInference: low\nThreshold: ≥ 30\nOutput: RoutingDirective"]
        C["COMPOSITE\nSENSOR\n──────────\nHunt claim:\nAttack confirmed\nInference: high\nThreshold: ≥ 75\nOutput: HunterDirective"]

        A -->|"Add scoring\nAdd routing\nMore inference"| B
        B -->|"Narrow to one technique\nOne noise domain\nADX validate\nMore inference"| C
    end

    style A fill:#0a1a0f,stroke:#00ff88,color:#00ff88
    style B fill:#1a1000,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#fcd34d
    style C fill:#0a1628,stroke:#00aaff,color:#7dd3fc
```

---

### What Changes as You Move Across the Spectrum

**From primitive to router rule:** a scoring model and routing output are added. The hunt now makes a claim about intent rather than just recording an event. The primitive `bitsadmin.exe executed` becomes the router rule claim `ingress transfer intent is present across this technique family`.

**From router rule to composite sensor:** the scope narrows to one technique, the rule is validated against real telemetry in ADX, a unified suppression model is applied, and the threshold is raised. The router rule claim `ingress transfer intent` becomes the composite claim `bitsadmin /transfer with remote URL and AppData staging path confirmed`.

**Primitives are not passive.** When you run a 30-day primitive collector across the estate looking for `scrcons.exe` loading script DLLs, you are hunting. You are asking a question of telemetry and receiving a list of facts. The inference depth is zero — but the analytical act is identical to every other layer.

### What Happens When You Strip a Router Rule Down

Remove the scoring, remove the routing, remove the phase structure — keep only the Phase 1 broad surface filter. The router rule becomes a primitive collector.

The Phase 1 filter of Hunt Pack 04 (Ingress Tool Transfer) with no threshold and no scoring is a primitive index of every LOLBin downloader execution on the estate for the last 30 days. That is architecturally valid and useful — but it serves a different purpose at a different inference point on the spectrum.

### The Corrected Framework Statement

```
Primitives        → threat hunts at zero inference
Router Rules      → threat hunts at low-medium inference
Composite Sensors → threat hunts at high inference

All three are hunts.
What changes is the claim being made,
the evidence required to make it,
and the action the analyst takes when it fires.
```

| **Lifecycle** | Permanent | Temporary | Permanent once ADX validated |
| **Analyst action** | Stitch via entity key | Run composite on DeviceId | Investigate · create incident |
| **Noise tolerance** | High — wide net | Medium — scored intent | Low — minimum truth required |

## The Problem With Most Detection Rules

Most enterprise SOC environments are defended by rules built on three flawed assumptions:

**1. Attackers follow predictable sequences.**  
Real intrusions are temporally fractured. C2 jitter, staged payloads, and multi-day dwell deliberately break join-dependent detection chains.

**2. A single event is enough to alert.**  
Single-event rules produce noise. Analysts tune them out or drown in false positives. Neither outcome serves defence.

**3. The rule's job ends at the alert.**  
An alert without analyst direction is a starting gun with no finish line. Context-free detection wastes the only thing SOC analysts don't have: time.

**This framework addresses all three.**

Why composites survive where traditional rules fail:

    end

    subgraph COMPOSITE ["✅ Minimum Truth Composite — Resilient"]
        direction TB

        C2 --> C3["Noise\nGates"]
        C3 --> C4["Scored\nHunter Output"]

    end

    classDef note      fill:#3f1f1f,stroke:#DC2626,color:#FCA5A5,font-size:11px
    classDef notegreen fill:#1a3f2f,stroke:#059669,color:#6EE7B7,font-size:11px
```

The composite architecture forces **narrative convergence at the exact moment an attacker touches an unavoidable telemetric choke point** — regardless of timing, tooling, or evasion.

### 05 · ATT&CK Substrate Adjacency — Detection Coverage Beyond Technique Taxonomy

> *"ATT&CK tells you what technique the attacker used. Substrate Adjacency tells you which three techniques they will pivot to when you detect the first one."*

MITRE ATT&CK models attacker behaviour **vertically** — tactic → technique → sub-technique. What it does not model is **horizontal adjacency between techniques operating on different substrates**. An adversary blocked on SMB pivots instantly to WinRM, then DCOM, then WMI. Each is a separate ATT&CK technique. All represent the same adversary intent. Detecting one while missing the others is not coverage — it is a **Coverage Illusion**.

This document introduces **Substrate Adjacency** — the missing horizontal layer that sits on top of ATT&CK. It formalises the **Cousin Technique Doctrine**: the principle that adjacent techniques sharing the same adversary intent require separate, purpose-built sensors deployed as an ecosystem, with the incident layer stitching cousin surface fires into a unified attack narrative.

**Covers:** Coverage Illusion · Cousin Technique Doctrine · Lateral Movement, Persistence, Execution, Credential Access, and Defense Evasion ecosystems mapped with cousin surfaces · Coverage Maturity Model (Level 0–4) · Integration with the Minimum Truth Framework layers

### 06 · SilverFox / ValleyRAT — BYOVD vs Polymorphic Malware: Why Signatures Fail and Behaviour Wins

> *"SilverFox does not exploit a zero-day. It exploits the trust Windows places in signed binaries. The signature is the weapon."*

SilverFox and ValleyRAT represent a category of Chinese-nexus threat actor tradecraft that weaponises Windows driver trust to achieve kernel-level EDR blinding before any overtly malicious activity occurs. The attack uses **byte-flipping mutation** — flipping a single non-authenticated byte in a legitimate signed driver's PE header. The file hash changes. The digital signature remains valid. Every hash-based IOC, every VirusTotal lookup, every blocklist fails silently.

This document delivers a complete offensive and defensive breakdown of the BYOVD chain: from fake installer delivery through DLL sideloading, driver staging, kernel service registration, EDR blinding, and ValleyRAT C2 establishment. It contrasts the byte-flipping technique against classical polymorphic malware to explain precisely why signature-based controls fail and why **behavioural composite detection is the only viable defence**.

**Covers:** Byte-flipping vs polymorphism technical comparison · Full kill chain with offensive perspective · Three-tier detection architecture (Atomic → Core+ → Advanced Kill-Chain) · MITRE ATT&CK mapping · Behavioural IOC catalogue · Validation and testing matrix · Full IR lifecycle

📄 **[SilverFox-BYOVD-Vs-Polymorphic-Malware-README.md](https://github.com/azdabat/Novel-Tradecraft-Research-Emerging-Attack-Ecosystems/blob/main/SilverFox-BYOVD-Vs-Polymorphic-Malware-README.md)**

### 07 · Adversary-Informed Threat Hunting — MDE & Sentinel Playbook

> *"Threat hunting is not searching for known bad. It is reasoning about what an attacker must have done, then finding the evidence that confirms or refutes it."*

Most SOC teams hunt reactively — an alert fires, an analyst investigates. This playbook inverts that model. It operationalises **hypothesis-driven, adversary-informed hunting** built on the intersection of PEAK, TAHITI, and the Minimum Truth Detection Framework — where every hunt begins with a formally stated hypothesis anchored on what an attacker *must* have done, not what a vendor signature happened to catch.

The playbook covers the complete hunt lifecycle, the methodology for building and validating hunt hypotheses, full telemetry mapping across MDE Advanced Hunting and Microsoft Sentinel, and **20 production-grade hunt rules** for 2026 — each demonstrated from both a red team (Empire / Atomic Red Team) and blue team perspective, with Azure Sentinel and MDE-aligned KQL. These are the techniques most SOC teams miss: DCSync via replication rights, WMI silent persistence, DCOM lateral movement, statistical C2 jitter detection, NTDS extraction via VSS, named pipe C2, and more.

**Covers:** PEAK + TAHITI + Minimum Truth integrated methodology · Hypothesis construction framework · MDE vs Sentinel — when to use which · 20 adversary-informed hunt rules with Empire telemetry · Red team attack vectors with Atomic Red Team references · Hunt-to-production-rule promotion pipeline · Weekly hunt schedule · Escalation and output classification

### 08 · Threat Hunting vs Detection Engineering — When to Hunt, When to Engineer, and Why the Difference Matters

> *"A hunt is a question. A rule is a settled answer. Know which you're writing before you open your editor."*

Threat hunting and detection engineering are two fundamentally different disciplines that feed each other — and conflating them produces rules that are too broad for production and hunts too narrow to find anything new. This document resolves that confusion with precision. It defines the exact decision boundary between the two modes, the formal pipeline for promoting a validated hunt finding into a production composite rule, and the methodology that sits beneath every rule in this framework.

Built around the intersection of **PEAK** (Prepare → Execute → Act), **TAHITI** (Target → Approach → Hunting → Identify → Triage → Investigate), and the **Minimum Truth Detection Framework** — with the MTF as the content doctrine and PEAK/TAHITI as the operational scaffolding — this document answers the questions that most detection programmes never formally address: *What is the minimum evidence of truth? When does a hypothesis become a rule? How does novel threat intelligence get translated into production-grade detection?*

Practical hunt playbooks cover the scenarios most defenders encounter but few have documented at this level of rigour: pre-encryption convergence hunting for LockBit-family ransomware, proactive permission and ACL exposure discovery, file share enumeration and exfiltration surface mapping, and credential file exposure hunts — including the `password.xls` class of misconfiguration that sits quietly on shares until an attacker with any foothold finds it first. A complete novel threat onboarding workflow demonstrates the full process end-to-end using InvisibleFerret (Void Dokkaebi, 2026) as the worked example.

**Covers:** Core distinction between threat hunting and detection engineering with decision matrix · PEAK lifecycle applied to MTF with worked examples · TAHITI process model with per-phase KQL guidance · Hunt-to-composite promotion pipeline with gate criteria · Badge assignment decision logic (KQL ADX Validated · PEAK/TAHITI Aligned · Cousin Technique Doctrine · MDE · Sentinel · Novel Tradecraft) · LockBit pre-encryption convergence hunt · Permission and file share exposure hunts · Password file exposure hunt (`password.xls`, credential naming patterns) · Novel threat onboarding workflow from intelligence to composite rule · Rule quality rubric — eight checks before production promotion

### 09 · AI-Accelerated Attack Surface Evolution — Composite Behavioural Detection in the Age of Polymorphic Malware

> *"The binary changes. The hash changes. The signature mutates. But to achieve the operational goal — the attacker must still load the driver, touch LSASS, or establish the pipe. That behavioural truth is what we anchor on. Everything else is noise."*

Signature-based detection is built on a premise AI has now structurally invalidated: that knowing what an attack *looks like* is sufficient to detect it. An LLM can generate a unique, syntactically valid, functionally equivalent payload variant in seconds — targeting your specific detection rules, rotating obfuscation patterns, and automating the evasion iteration cycle that previously took skilled operators days. **Hash blocklists cannot keep pace. Byte-flip polymorphism preserves valid driver signatures while defeating every blocklist simultaneously. The only viable anchor is what the attack must *do*.**

This document applies the Minimum Truth doctrine to the most critical AI-accelerated attack classes: **SilverFox / ValleyRAT BYOVD** — a Chinese-nexus campaign using byte-flip mutation to produce unique-hash, valid-signature kernel driver variants per campaign; **PowerShell Empire AI-assisted stagers** with automated AMSI bypass and obfuscation rotation; **WMI Fileless Persistence** exploiting the DLL load substrate that survives every command-line evasion; and **OAuth Consent Abuse** where AI generates optimised phishing lures and selects high-risk permission scopes calibrated to evade detection thresholds. For each chain, the document provides a three-tier composite detection architecture — hash-invariant, signature-invariant, binary-invariant — anchored on the behavioural sequence that AI cannot mutate away.

**Covers:** AI capability shifts in offensive security · Byte-flip polymorphism vs classical mutation · Command-line execution evasion timeline (2015–2026) · SilverFox / ValleyRAT three-tier BYOVD detection (Tier 1 atomic → Tier 2 chain → Tier 3 full kill-chain) · Empire PowerShell stager composite · WMI fileless scrcons.exe substrate sensor · OAuth consent abuse with production bug fixes applied · STRIDE threat modelling methodology alignment · PEAK / NIST CSF / OWASP LLM Top 10 framework mapping · Cousin technique coverage table with AI evasion resistance analysis

### 10 · Advanced Threat Hunting — Senior Analyst Reference: Detection, Investigation & Incident Response

> *"Threat hunting is not the absence of alerts. It is the deliberate search for adversary behaviour that has not yet produced an alert — and the engineering of detections so that next time, it does."*

Advanced threat hunting operates at the intersection of telemetry analysis, adversary tradecraft, and detection engineering. This repository documents a complete senior analyst reference for hunting and investigating the most evasion-resistant threats in the 2026 landscape — techniques that survive signature-based controls, bypass usermode EDR hooks, operate entirely within legitimate system infrastructure, or route command-and-control through public internet services that cannot be blocklisted.

The threats covered represent the current frontier of EDR evasion: **SilverFox / ValleyRAT BYOVD** — where byte-flip polymorphism produces unique-hash, valid-signature kernel drivers per campaign, and a confirmed kernel load means the EDR is already blind before the alert fires; **EtherRAT blockchain C2** — where the command channel is the public Ethereum blockchain and no suspicious IP or domain ever exists; **Kerberoasting and AS-REP Roasting** — pure Active Directory protocol abuse with no malicious binary, no suspicious process, and no network anomaly detectable without identity telemetry; **Living-off-the-land fileless execution chains** including direct syscall bypass, process hollowing, and reflective injection hidden inside legitimate signed processes; **AI-assisted supply chain compromise** targeting CI/CD pipelines and package registries; and **MFA fatigue and PPL bypass** — two of the highest-impact, lowest-visibility techniques active in enterprise environments in 2026.

Every threat is covered with a full investigation methodology: hypothesis formation, MDE Advanced Hunting and Microsoft Sentinel KQL queries, Mermaid attack chain diagrams, cousin technique mapping, attack timeline reconstruction, blast radius assessment, and the complete senior incident response lifecycle from triage to detection engineering. The repository also includes a comprehensive README covering PEAK and TAHITI hunt framework alignment, the MTDF minimum truth doctrine applied to hunting, telemetry gap analysis, entity key pivot methodology, and the detection improvement loop that converts every confirmed incident into a production composite rule.

**Covers:** BYOVD kill chain hunting · EtherRAT beacon interval analysis · Kerberoasting RC4 volume detection · LOLBin parent-child chain mapping · Direct syscall bypass indicators · Supply chain CI/CD compromise · MFA fatigue pattern detection · PPL bypass and LSASS access sequences · Master timeline builder KQL · Blast radius assessment queries · IR decision trees · PEAK / TAHITI / MTDF framework alignment · Telemetry gap analysis · Hidden-in-legitimate-file technique catalogue

### 11 · MTDF AI Copilot — Agentic Detection Engineering Pipeline: Architecture, Implementation & Operational Guide

> *"The Copilot does not replace the detection engineer. It accelerates them — enforcing doctrine, preventing implementation bugs, and generating schema-precise rule scaffolds that the engineer validates, calibrates, and commits."*

Detection engineering at scale requires simultaneous mastery of five domains: schema precision, KQL engine behaviour, detection doctrine, adversary tradecraft, and operational constraints. Without tooling, even experienced engineers produce rules that are logically correct but technically flawed, or technically correct but doctrinally wrong. The five production bug classes documented in the MTDF engineering errors reference were all found in rules written without automated doctrine enforcement. This R&D document is the master reference for the MTDF AI Copilot — an agentic LLM detection engineering pipeline that solves this problem end-to-end.

The pipeline runs **AnythingLLM desktop** as the orchestration and RAG layer, backed by **Claude Sonnet 4.6 via the Anthropic API** at temperature=0 for deterministic output, with a nine-section v4 system prompt that enforces the complete MTDF doctrine as non-negotiable operating constraints. The workspace carries the full MDE and Sentinel schema reference, all five skeleton templates, Empire C2 attack telemetry as RAG-accessible signal documents, and validated production rules as quality calibration examples. The model cannot generate a rule without first declaring the anchoring strategy, selecting the correct skeleton, stating the minimum truth anchor, and documenting the minimum fire path — and cannot skip any of the ten production engineering rules derived from the systematic bug review.

This document covers the complete operational guide for the pipeline: the architecture and component decisions, why Ollama local models were abandoned in favour of the Claude API, the full v4 system prompt design rationale section by section, workspace configuration, and five reusable prompt templates for every rule generation scenario — Intent-First, Substrate-First, Sentinel, multi-platform, and the master Empire kill chain prompt that generates nine production-candidate rules in sequence. It documents all seven failure modes with correction prompts that can be sent immediately when a violation is detected, and explains exactly how to validate generated rules — the answer to whether AnythingLLM can test rules against injested Empire telemetry (it cannot — it is a RAG system, not a query engine), and the full step-by-step guide for ADX-Docker validation covering both the Azure free cluster path and the fully local Docker path, including table creation commands, JSON ingestion mapping, rule adaptation for static telemetry, and what a valid production receipt looks like. The document closes with the incremental fine-tuning model — how validated rules are fed back into the workspace as quality examples, how the system prompt is versioned as the rule library grows, and the complete eleven-step workflow from prompt to GitHub commit.

**Covers:** Pipeline architecture · ADX-Docker vs AnythingLLM validation · System prompt v4 design · Ten engineering rules rationale · Five reusable prompt templates · Master Empire kill chain prompt · Seven failure modes + correction prompts · ADX free cluster setup · ADX Docker local setup · KQL table creation commands · JSON telemetry ingestion guide · Production receipt standard · System prompt versioning · Quality calibration accumulation · Session management best practices

### 11 · MTDF AI Copilot — Agentic Detection Engineering Pipeline: Architecture, Implementation & Operational Guide

> *"The Copilot does not replace the detection engineer. It accelerates them — enforcing doctrine, preventing implementation bugs, classifying rule architecture before generating, and producing scaffolds that the engineer validates, calibrates, and commits."*

Detection engineering at scale requires simultaneous mastery of five domains: schema precision, KQL engine behaviour, detection doctrine, adversary tradecraft, and operational constraints. Without tooling, even experienced engineers produce rules that are logically correct but technically flawed, or architecturally wrong for their operational purpose. The MTDF AI Copilot solves this by operating as a doctrine-enforcement and classification engine built on AnythingLLM desktop, Claude Sonnet 4.6 via the Anthropic API at temperature=0, and a ten-section v5 system prompt with a mandatory rule classification protocol that runs before a single line of KQL is written.

The classification protocol is the architectural core of v5. Five questions are asked before every rule generation — scope, noise domain, fidelity requirement, telemetry availability, and operational context — each with a clear explanation of why it is being asked and what the answer means architecturally. The answers determine which of five architectures is declared: Composite Sensor (base 55, threshold 75, HunterDirective), Router Rule (base 0, threshold 30, RoutingDirective), Composite Pack, Hunt Query, or Router + Composite Pair. The ingress tool transfer case study — Hunt Pack 04 covering bitsadmin, certutil, curl, and PowerShell — is the canonical example of why a router rule is correct when multiple techniques have different noise domains, and why the T1197 BITSAdmin composite sensor must be built separately and retire bitsadmin from the router once ADX-validated.

The R&D document covers the full pipeline: why Ollama local models were abandoned, the v4 to v5 system prompt evolution, the workspace configuration with Empire telemetry as RAG documents, five reusable prompt templates for every rule generation scenario, eight failure modes with precise correction prompts, the definitive answer on why AnythingLLM cannot test KQL rules against ingested telemetry, step-by-step ADX validation via both Azure free cluster and local Docker including table creation commands and telemetry ingestion mapping, the incremental fine-tuning model as validated rules accumulate as workspace quality examples, and the complete eleven-step workflow from classification to GitHub commit.

**Covers:** Classification protocol · Router vs Composite architecture decision · Five reusable prompt templates · Eight failure modes + correction prompts · ADX-Docker validation step-by-step · AnythingLLM workspace configuration · Ten engineering rules rationale · Incremental fine-tuning model · Session management · Version history v1–v5

### 12 · Router Rules — How Sensors Become Incidents: The Attack Narrative Pipeline

> *"Router rules detect intent. Ecosystem composites confirm truth. A router rule that is never retired is coverage debt, not architecture."*

In production detection estates, a second class of rules operates alongside composite sensors — rules that exist not to confirm a specific minimum truth, but to cast a wide surface across multiple techniques that share the same adversary goal while having fundamentally different noise domains. These are Router Rules: the architectural mechanism that prevents the two worst outcomes in enterprise detection engineering — the monolithic rule that combines incompatible techniques and cannot be tuned without creating blind spots, and the coverage gap that exists while dedicated composites are being built and validated.

This document is the complete reference for the Router Rule doctrine within the Minimum Truth Detection Framework. It establishes why the ingress tool transfer case study — bitsadmin, certutil, curl, and PowerShell grouped together in Hunt Pack 04 — is the canonical example of a valid router rule. Each tool operates in a completely different enterprise noise domain: bitsadmin in SCCM and Windows Update contexts, certutil in developer PKI tooling, curl in DevOps CI/CD pipelines. Combining them in a composite sensor produces a rule that cannot suppress SCCM false positives without creating blind spots for developer abuse, and cannot tune for DevOps noise without hiding the most suspicious signals. The router rule covers all four with a base score of zero, a threshold of 30, and a RoutingDirective that tells the analyst which dedicated composite to run per signal type — with a live decomposition tracker documenting when each technique should be retired from the router as its composite is ADX-validated.

The document covers the two-rule-type architecture in full: the scoring model difference between base 0 (router) and base 55 (composite), the interaction model showing how a router and composite work as a pipeline rather than competitors, the complete router rule template with decomposition tracker, the validity criteria defining when a router rule is architecturally appropriate and when it is not, and the sequence diagram showing how router breadth and composite depth stitch together at the incident layer via entity keys.

**Covers:** Router Rule doctrine · Two-rule-type architecture · Ingress tool transfer case study · Decomposition tracker · Routing directive vs Hunter directive · Scoring architecture difference (base 0 vs base 55) · Validity criteria · Router + Composite interaction model · Coverage debt vs coverage architecture · Retirement workflow

## 🗺️ God Mode Composite Roadmap

**[→ OPEN INTERACTIVE ROADMAP](https://azdabat.github.io/Minimum-Truth-Detection-Framework-ADX-Validated-Composite-Rules/index.html)**

The God Mode Composite Roadmap is the capstone artefact of the Minimum Truth Detection Framework — a complete, interactive reference mapping every major ATT&CK tactic to its **core baseline composite rule**, its **cousin technique ecosystem**, and a **full red team breakdown** of how each attack is deployed in the real world.

This is not a vendor rule pack or an ATT&CK navigator heatmap. It is a living R&D document that answers three questions for every detection:

- **Why is this composite shaped this way?** — the blue team rationale, minimum truth anchor, and reinforcement signal logic
- **How does an attacker actually deploy this technique?** — CEH/OSCP level methodology, tool names, real malware families, full kill chain position
- **What are the cousin attack surfaces?** — adjacent techniques that share substrate or intent primitives, each with their own composite and red team context

### Coverage

| Tactic | Core Composites | Cousin Rules |
|---|---|---|
| Execution | PowerShell, WMI, LOLBins | AMSI bypass, download cradles, mshta, rundll32, regsvr32 |

| Defense Evasion | BYOVD, EDR kill chain | Byte-flip mutation, callback deregistration |
| Credential Access | LSASS memory dump | DCSync, Kerberoasting |
| Discovery | Velocity sweep composite | BloodHound/LDAP enumeration |

### 9 Novel Research Tab

The roadmap includes a dedicated tab for original MTDF threat research — families with no vendor rule coverage, fully documented from kill chain through detection engineering:

- **SilverFox / ValleyRAT** — 7-rule, 3-tier detection covering the complete BYOVD EDR kill chain including byte-flip hash mutation defence
- **EtherRAT / React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182)** — Blockchain C2 detection via Ethereum RPC polling; the C2 channel is the public blockchain itself
- **Steganographic Loader Ecosystem** — Multi-phase detection covering LSB image inspection, .NET in-memory execution, and full IR SOP

## Detection Engineering Architecture: Temporal Deception Defence

Modern adversary tradecraft relies on two compounding problems for defenders:

**Temporal Deception** — C2 jitter, staggered BYOVD deployment, and delayed execution are specifically designed to fracture event sequences that join-dependent rules depend on.

**Substrate Pivoting** — Attackers move laterally across execution substrates (registry → service → WMI → named pipe) to avoid any single telemetry surface being sufficient for detection.

The architecture response is a **hybrid sensor deployment**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph SENSOR ["Behavioural Composite Layer"]
        S1["Single-Surface\nComposites"] --> S2["High-confidence\nHunterDirectives"]
    end

    subgraph STITCH ["Incident Stitching Layer"]

    end

    SENSOR --> O1

    O1 & O2 --> O3["Analyst Action\nFull Kill Chain Context"]
```

> Separating the **sensor architecture** from **chronological storytelling** achieves scale-safe efficiency. The composite fires on the choke point. The stitching engine assembles the narrative. The analyst receives both simultaneously.
